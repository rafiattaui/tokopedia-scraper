## Installation

### Download a WebDriver

You need a WebDriver for this program to run on.
You should use a chrome WebDriver for this, available here:
https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/.
Drag the chromedriver folder into this program's directory, and update your Google Chrome to prevent errors.

### Initialize a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)
